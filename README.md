6/28: Need to correct some lighting issues and positons of a few objects. The objects were all created seperately and then merged into one main file. Additionally, I need to add textures to both Spongebob and Patrick, their houses, and possibly the background as well to have the underwater theme.  I also want to attempt to add motion still but simplify it to them running in a circle in the middle of all their homes as they would do in the actual show to annoy Squidward.

7/1: Fixed lighting issues and added textures to all objects with a skybox for the underwater theme with Squidward dabbing in his window. The hardest part for me was to implement the textures as I kept running into the bmp error of the image being 32 RGBA instead of 24 RGB. I eventually overcame this using Photoshop ot edit some of my images. Also, I cut down the code by reusing a lot of the shapes I previously had and and making it cleaner to read.
